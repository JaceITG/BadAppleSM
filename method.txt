m1500 0%mini shows 1 beat on screen
use 2x scroll sections to make it work for m750

Timing
~~~~~~
By setting the chart tempo to 240bpm, each measure is 1 second in length, allowing
a direct conversion from Frames/Second => Frames/Measure.
This is helpful for organization of the .ssc file


Generating the .ssc
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Each frame is encased in a warp, denoted in ssc header with
`{beat}=1.000,`

Each frame starts with a scroll speed set
`{beat}={scroll_multiplier},`
And ends with a scroll speed reset
`{beat}=0.000,`

Doubles notation, using one or fraction of one beat for each frame

Example measure with 2 frames:
